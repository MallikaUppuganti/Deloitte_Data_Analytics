## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I am a Data Analyst working with two real-world datasets focused on manufacturing operations and gender pay equality. The goal was to extract actionable insights using data analysis and visualization — assisting business stakeholders in understanding risks, performance gaps and compliance issues.

I used Excel for forensic-style classification and Tableau for building an interactive dashboard that supports executive decision-making.

## 🧩 Tasks & Deliverables
**🔧 Task 1:** Machine Downtime Analysis using Tableau

**Objective** Identify operational inefficiencies and high-risk machines from factory machine telemetry.

What I did:

* Analyzed machine health metrics across multiple factories

* Created a custom calculated field to classify machines as “Unhealthy” or “Healthy”

* Designed bar charts and filters to compare breakdown frequency across locations

* Highlighted Factory A as the most failure-prone site and pinpointed specific machines causing repeated downtime

* Delivered an interactive Tableau dashboard to allow factory managers to explore downtime trends by machine and location

**🔍 Key Insight:** Factory A had the highest breakdown count, with certain machines contributing disproportionately — a signal for preventive maintenance.

**⚖️ Task 2:** Gender Pay Equality Classification in Excel

**Objective:** Evaluate salary fairness across genders and flag discriminatory pay structures.

What I did:

* Cleaned and normalized the raw employee salary dataset

* Applied logical rules to compute pay gap thresholds

* Created a new column Equality Class with three distinct labels:

  * Fair (minimal pay gap)

  * Unfair (moderate discrepancy)

  * Highly Discriminative (large or systemic gap)

* Used conditional formatting to visually distinguish records and enhance interpretability

* Delivered a well-structured, business-ready Excel sheet for HR decision-makers

**🔍 Key Insight:** Several roles, particularly in mid-level technical and operational categories, showed systematic underpayment of one gender — actionable for HR.

## ✅ Key Outcomes
* Developed a decision-ready Tableau dashboard for manufacturing insights

* Delivered an Excel-based forensic pay analysis tool for HR review

* Demonstrated the ability to work across domains — operations and HR analytics

* Strengthened my skills in business problem-solving, not just technical execution

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
 📊 Data Analysis
 
 📗 Excel Spreadsheets — Data preprocessing, Computing

## ✨ Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how I, as a data analyst, translate business questions into structured insights using the right tools. It shows:

* A solid grasp of data-driven problem-solving

* Attention to both technical detail and stakeholder expectations

* Proficiency in Tableau and Excel for two very different use cases

* Strong foundations in ethical analytics — including bias detection and fairness analysis
